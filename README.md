### Covid 19 Tracker

Hello, Im pradana.
Currently on this project I use some [covid trakcer API](https://rapidapi.com/Gramzivi/api/covid-19-data/) from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/), and inspired with [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/14925214-Covid-19-Disease-statistics-Mobile-App/attachments/6640605?mode=media).

Today on Monday, 7 Feb 2022 I had submit all the necessary code for this application to work, for the future note I will add some other features like MVVM, refresh indicator and other pages.
